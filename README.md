# FalconCMS

FalconCMS is a CMS for Habbo emulators. It currently targets Arcturus MorningStar emulator,
 but intends on supporting multiple emulators. This CMS is coded using the Django framework
 for Python. This CMS can be ran either by CPython through WSGI, directly or it can also be
 compiled as a WAR file and ran under a Java Servlet container.
 
# Branching

There are two major branches in this project:
 * master
 * development

The development branch is always what developers are currently working on, and the master branch reflects the
last commit matching a release. You may not want to ever use code from development unless you know what you're
doing, being asked to do so by a developer or are developing FalconCMS.
